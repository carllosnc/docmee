# Haskell

## 1. Fundamentals of Haskell
- **Basic Syntax and Structure**
  - [Understand Haskell’s syntax rules, indentation, and module structure.](./haskell/syntax_guide)
  - Learn to use GHCi (Glasgow Haskell Compiler Interactive) for experimentation.
  - Write simple programs using `main` and basic I/O (e.g., `putStrLn`, `getLine`).
- **Types and Type Signatures**
  - Study basic types: `Int`, `Integer`, `Double`, `Char`, `Bool`, `String`.
  - Learn to read and write type signatures for functions.
  - Explore type inference and how Haskell assigns types automatically.
- **Functions and Pattern Matching**
  - Define functions using equations and pattern matching.
  - Understand guards for conditional logic.
  - Practice recursion as a primary control structure.

## 2. Core Functional Programming Concepts
- **Pure Functions and Immutability**
  - Grasp the concept of pure functions (no side effects).
  - Understand immutability and its role in Haskell programming.
- **Higher-Order Functions**
  - Learn to use functions like `map`, `filter`, and `foldr`/`foldl`.
  - Explore function composition using `(.)` and point-free style.
- **Lambda Expressions**
  - Create anonymous functions with lambda syntax.
  - Use lambdas in combination with higher-order functions.

## 3. Working with Data Structures
- **Lists and Tuples**
  - Master list operations (e.g., cons `(:)`, concatenation `(++)`, head, tail).
  - Understand tuples for fixed-size, heterogeneous data.
  - Use list comprehensions for concise data transformations.
- **Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)**
  - Define custom data types using `data` keyword (e.g., `Maybe`, `Either`).
  - Use pattern matching with custom types.
  - Explore record syntax for structured data.
- **Typeclasses**
  - Understand common typeclasses: `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Read`.
  - Learn how to implement typeclass instances for custom types.
  - Study `Num`, `Fractional`, and `Integral` for numeric operations.

## 4. Advanced Haskell Features
- **Monads**
  - Start with the `Maybe` and `List` monads for simple examples.
  - Learn the `IO` monad for handling input/output.
  - Understand `do` notation for sequencing monadic operations.
- **Functors and Applicatives**
  - Explore `Functor` for types that support mapping (e.g., `fmap`).
  - Study `Applicative` for applying functions within contexts.
  - Compare `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` to understand their relationships.
- **Type System Advanced Features**
  - Learn about type families and GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types).
  - Explore type constraints and polymorphism in depth.
  - Understand `newtype` for type-safe wrappers.

## 5. Practical Haskell Programming
- **Modules and Imports**
  - Organize code into modules using `module` and `import`.
  - Learn qualified imports and hiding specific functions.
- **Error Handling**
  - Use `Maybe` and `Either` for explicit error handling.
  - Explore exceptions in the `IO` monad using `try` and `catch`.
- **Working with Libraries**
  - Use Cabal or Stack for project management and dependencies.
  - Explore popular libraries like `text`, `bytestring`, and `containers`.
  - Learn to read and navigate Hackage documentation.

## 6. Advanced Functional Programming Techniques
- **Monadic Transformers**
  - Understand `MaybeT`, `StateT`, and `ReaderT` for combining monads.
  - Practice stacking monads to handle complex computations.
- **Laziness and Performance**
  - Learn how Haskell’s lazy evaluation works and its implications.
  - Use strictness annotations (e.g., `!`) and `seq` to control evaluation.
  - Analyze performance with tools like GHC’s profiler.
- **Parallel and Concurrent Programming**
  - Explore parallelism with `par` and `pseq` for multicore processing.
  - Learn concurrency with `MVar`, `STM` (Software Transactional Memory), and `forkIO`.

## 7. Building Real-World Applications
- **Web Development**
  - Build simple web servers using `scotty` or `yesod`.
  - Handle JSON data with `aeson` for API development.
- **Parsing and Domain-Specific Languages**
  - Use `parsec` or `megaparsec` for parsing text.
  - Create small DSLs using Haskell’s type system and monads.
- **Testing and Debugging**
  - Write unit tests using `HUnit` or `QuickCheck`.
  - Debug programs with `trace` and GHCi’s debugging tools.

## 8. Resources and Practice
- **Books and Tutorials**
  - Read *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* for beginner-friendly explanations.
  - Study *Haskell Programming from First Principles* for in-depth learning.
  - Follow online tutorials like those on Haskell.org or FP Complete.
- **Practice Projects**
  - Build small projects: a calculator, a todo list app, or a simple game.
  - Contribute to open-source Haskell projects on GitHub.
- **Community Engagement**
  - Join Haskell communities on X, Reddit, or Discord for support.
  - Attend Haskell meetups or conferences like Haskell eXchange.

## Learning Tips
- Practice daily by solving problems on platforms like Exercism or HackerRank.
- Use GHCi to experiment with small code snippets.
- Break down complex concepts (e.g., monads) into smaller, manageable parts.
- Revisit earlier topics to reinforce understanding as you progress.
