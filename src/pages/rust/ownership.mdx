# Ownership in Rust

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature, enabling memory safety guarantees without a garbage collector. It's a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.

## The Ownership Rules

1.  Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its *owner*.
2.  There can only be one owner at a time.
3.  When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be *dropped*.

## 1. Scope

A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.

**Example: Variable Scope**
```rust
fn main() {
    {
        // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = "hello"; // s is valid from this point forward
        // do stuff with s
    } // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
}
```

## 2. Move Semantics

When a variable holding data on the heap (like `String`) is assigned to another variable, the ownership is *moved*, not copied. The original variable becomes invalid.

**Example: String Move**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1's ownership is moved to s2. s1 is no longer valid.

    // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error!
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

**Example: Function Ownership Transfer**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("world"); // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function...
                        // ... and so is no longer valid here

    // println!("{}", s); // This would cause a compile-time error!

    let x = 5; // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x); // x would move into the function, but i32 is Copy,
                   // so it's still valid afterward
    println!("{}", x); // This is allowed
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called.
  // The backing memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

## 3. Clone

If you *do* want to deeply copy the heap data of a `String`, you can use the `clone` method.

**Example: Cloning a String**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // s1 is still valid after cloning.

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
}
```

## 4. Borrowing (References)

To allow functions to use a value without taking ownership, you can pass a *reference* to it. This is called borrowing.

**Example: Immutable Reference**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // Pass a reference to s1

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len); // s1 is still valid
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, it is not dropped.
```

## 5. Mutable References

You can have a *mutable reference* to change the value it refers to. However, you can only have *one* mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope.

**Example: Mutable Reference**
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s); // Pass a mutable reference to s

    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

**Example: One Mutable Reference Rule**
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s; // First mutable reference
    // let r2 = &mut s; // This would cause a compile-time error!

    // println!("{}, {}", r1, r2); // Error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    println!("{}", r1);
}
```

**Example: Multiple Immutable References vs. One Mutable Reference**
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

## 6. Dangling References

In Rust, the compiler guarantees that references will never be *dangling* (referring to data that has been deallocated). This is achieved by checking lifetimes.

**Example: Preventing Dangling References (Compile-time Error)**
```rust
// This function would not compile!
// fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String
//     let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String
//     &s // we return a reference to the String, s
// } // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory is deallocated.
  // The reference we tried to return would be dangling!

fn no_dangle() -> String { // Returns the String directly, transferring ownership
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s // Ownership of s is moved out of the function
}

fn main() {
    let s = no_dangle();
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

## 7. Ownership with Structs

Ownership rules apply to structs as well. When a struct is dropped, its owned data is also dropped.

**Example: Struct Ownership**
```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    // user1 owns its String data. When user1 goes out of scope, email and username are dropped.
    println!("User email: {}", user1.email);
}
```

**Example: Struct with References (Lifetimes)**
```rust
// This struct holds references, so it needs lifetime annotations.
// 'a (read as "tick a") is a lifetime parameter.
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };

    println!("Important excerpt: {}", i.part);
}
```

## 6. Dangling References

In Rust, the compiler guarantees that references will never be *dangling* (referring to data that has been deallocated). This is achieved by checking lifetimes.

**Example: Preventing Dangling References (Compile-time Error)**
```rust
// This function would not compile!
// fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String
//     let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String
//     &s // we return a reference to the String, s
// } // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory is deallocated.
  // The reference we tried to return would be dangling!

fn no_dangle() -> String { // Returns the String directly, transferring ownership
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s // Ownership of s is moved out of the function
}

fn main() {
    let s = no_dangle();
    println!("{}", s);
}
```
