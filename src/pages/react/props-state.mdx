# Props vs State

## Overview

Props and state are both fundamental concepts in React for managing data, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

## Props (Properties)

Props are arguments passed into React components, similar to function parameters. They allow data to flow from parent components to child components.

### Key Characteristics

**Read-only**: Props are immutable within the receiving component. A child component cannot modify the props it receives.

**Passed from parent**: Props are always passed down from a parent component to its children, establishing a one-way data flow.

**External data**: Props represent data that comes from outside the component.

### Example

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}
```

In this example, `name` is a prop passed from `App` to `Greeting`.

## State

State is internal data that a component manages itself. It represents information that can change over time, typically in response to user actions or other events.

### Key Characteristics

**Mutable**: State can be updated using `setState` (class components) or the `useState` hook (functional components).

**Owned by component**: Each component manages its own state privately.

**Triggers re-renders**: When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new data.

### Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, `count` is state managed internally by the `Counter` component.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Props | State |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Mutability** | Immutable (read-only) | Mutable (can be changed) |
| **Ownership** | Passed from parent | Owned by component |
| **Purpose** | Configure child components | Manage dynamic data |
| **Changes** | Cause re-render when parent updates | Cause re-render when updated |
| **Access** | Accessible via `props` parameter | Managed via `useState` or `this.state` |

## When to Use Each

### Use Props When:
- You need to pass data from parent to child
- The data should not be modified by the receiving component
- You want to configure how a component looks or behaves
- You're creating reusable components with customizable properties

### Use State When:
- The component needs to track data that changes over time
- You're handling user input or interactions
- The data is internal to the component
- You need to trigger re-renders based on data changes

## Working Together

Props and state often work together in React applications. A common pattern is for a parent component to manage state and pass it down as props to child components. When the state changes in the parent, the children receive updated props and re-render accordingly.

```jsx
function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={username} 
        onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <Greeting name={username} />
    </div>
  );
}

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

In this example, `username` is state in `App`, but it's passed as a prop to `Greeting`. This creates a unidirectional data flow that makes React applications predictable and easier to debug.
